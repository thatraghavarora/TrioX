## 🚩 Problem Statement

Online platforms, forums, and mirror websites evolve rapidly.
Criminal and high-risk activities often:

* Limited visibility

* Collects data from public and authorized sources
* Aggregates intelligence into a single operational dashboard
* Logs every signal with timestamps and metadata
